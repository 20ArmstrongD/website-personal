    <p>
      I am a college student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, with a
      background in Film and Media. Having transitioned into the software
      development field, I am a beginner software developer, mostly self-taught
      with some formal education. My focus lies in embracing the latest
      technologies not only to enhance my personal growth but also to contribute
      to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in this domain.
      Moreover, I am committed to leveraging technology to benefit both
      companies and society at large. My philosophy centers around 'Think. Do.
      Learn.', emphasizing the importance of critical thinking, action, and
      continuous learning in achieving remarkable outcomes."
